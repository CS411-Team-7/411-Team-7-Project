As a user, I want to view the top 5 favorite recipes in order to see what are the most popular recipes among all users. When the app works properly, it should display a list of the top 5 recipes on the home page, decided by how many “favorites” a recipe has. It should also display a photo of the recipe, as well as the ingredients and the recipe itself. In addition, I should also be able to sort the presented recipes in terms of popularity, again as decided by the number of "favorites", recipes that are tied should be presented alphabetically. When the app is not working properly, there are not enough recipes that have been marked as "favorite" by users, at which point the app should display a message along the lines of "We are still developing a list of the 5 most popular recipes among users. Sorry for the inconvenience, but please check in again later!".
