As a user, I want to get a list of similar ingredients to the ones I upload in order to see what options I have as potential ingredient substitutes. When the app is working properly, The user will be able to click on the navigation bar and select “substitute” to enter the page. Once the user enters the page, The screen will display what the user’s ingredients are on file. The user can click on the ingredients, and then the webpage will show the possible substitutes based on the ingredient that was selected. The substitute options will be based on allergies, vegan preference, and calorie levels. When the app does not work properly, the ingredient the user selected will appear no substitute due to various reasons. In that case, The users can suggest their substitutes based on past experiences and their personal taste, and the website can either choose to approve it or mark it as “other users suggest…”
