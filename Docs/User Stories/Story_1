As a user, I want to select the ingredients that I have from a given list in order to find recipes that closely match those ingredients. When the app works properly, it should display a list of recipes that utilize one or more of the ingredients that I have chosen, as well as how closely the recipes match my list of ingredients (a literal percentage of how many of my ingredients are incorporated into the recipe). I should also be able to sort the recipes presented to me in order of relevance, in either ascending or descending order. When the app is not working properly, I cannot find a single recipe that matches the ingredients listed, at which point the app should encourage me to add more ingredients to my list in order to broaden the search, or to upload my own recipes that utilize the ingredients I have already listed.
