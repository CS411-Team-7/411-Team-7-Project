As a user, I want to search up a recipe in order to find the ingredients that are missing and create a cart. When the app works properly, the screen will display all the recipes relating to the keywords when the user clicks on “search” and type in the recipe the user is looking for. After typing and hitting enter, the recipes with matching keywords will be shown on top, and the list will also contain recipes that have less similarity in keywords, the amount of ingredients will not be considered. The user will be able to click on any of the recipes listed after the search and have the option to click on the ingredients they are missing and add it into the user’s shopping cart. When the app does not work properly that can mean that some of the displayed recipes are out of the user’s expectation. For example: when the user searched for “apple risotto”, a recipe for “apple tart” also showed up because they both contain the keyword “apple”. The user can report this issue by telling us the search algorithm is not accurate enough or we missed this relationship. We can solve this by showing the recipes that match 90% of the user's keyword first, and then showing the rest of the recipes in another section called “related recipes”. This will lower the user’s expectation when they see some unmatching recipes with similar keywords.
