As a user, I want to enter my allergies in order to avoid all recipes including ingredients that I am allergic to.  When the app works properly, I am able to list specific food items and categories of food that I am allergic to. As a result, all recipes accessible by the app should be sorted so that recipes with ingredients I am allergic to are marked. I should then be able to choose in my user preferences whether or not to display recipes that have been flagged as containing my allergens. When the app doesnâ€™t work properly, I have an allergy that is not recognized by the app and am unable to add it to my list of allergies, at which point the app should provide the ability to manually mark certain recipes as containing allergens as well as a form of communication with the developers in order to add support for certain allergies. If the app continues to present recipes that contain allergens, I should be able to report these recipes as containing my allergies, and the search algorithm should take this into account in the future.
